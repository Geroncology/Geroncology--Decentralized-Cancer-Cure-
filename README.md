# Geroncology--Decentralized-Cancer-Cure- 
**We are building a decentralized, open-source research collective to make cancer biologically impossible by reprogramming the tumor microenvironment.**  

Zero patents. Zero salaries until milestones. 100 % of funds go directly to wet-lab validation and clinical-grade synthesis.    

### The Problem  
- 20.3 million new cancer cases · 10.1 million deaths in 2024 (IARC GLOBOCAN)  
- Projected 35 million new cases/year by 2050  
- Median survival gain from new oncology drugs 2015–2024: **3.7 months**  
- Median annual cost of a new cancer drug in 2024: **US $324,000**  

The current system cannot produce cures because cures are not patentable at scale.

### Core Scientific Thesis  
Cancer is a systems failure of the **tumor microenvironment (TME)**.  
Remove the permissive ecosystem → no solid tumor can survive, regardless of driver mutations.

### Five-Pillar Reprogramming Strategy  

| Pillar                    | Target                                           | Intervention Class                                      | Status         |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Immune exclusion          | Tregs, MDSCs, M2 macrophages                     | Stapled peptides + repolarizers                         | Lead design    |
| Acidic niche              | pH 6.4–6.8 → 7.4–7.8                              | CAIX/XII inhibitors + buffered systems                 | Lead design    |
| Hypoxia & Warburg         | HIF-1α, MCT1/4, GLUT1                            | Triple metabolic blockade                               | Lead design    |
| Angiogenesis & metastasis | VEGF/PDGF/FGF, LOXL2, CAIX                       | Multi-ligand decoys + matrix inhibitors                 | Lead design    |
| Tumor-suppressor loss     | p53, PTEN, LKB1, Hippo/YAP                       | AI-designed stapled peptides & reactivators             | Lead design    |
